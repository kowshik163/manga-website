# 📚 MangaVerse – Manga Reading Website (Personal Project)

Welcome to **MangaVerse**, a personal manga reading website project built with love by a fellow anime fan! 🎌✨

This is a **commercial project** that I'm building myself — but I’m inviting web developers and enthusiasts to contribute and help bring it to life. It’s a great opportunity to work on a real-world project, build your portfolio, and have fun with manga!

This project uses the **[MangaDex API](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/)** for manga content, including series info, chapters, and images.

- The API is open and well-documented, provided by the [MangaDex team on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mangadex-pub/mangadex-api).
- We do **not** own or host any manga content. This site only **uses public endpoints** provided by MangaDex.
