# 📚 MangaVerse – Manga Reading Website (Personal Project)

Welcome to **MangaVerse**, a personal manga reading website project built with love by a fellow anime fan! 🎌✨

This is a **commercial project** that I'm building myself — but I’m inviting web developers and enthusiasts to contribute and help bring it to life. It’s a great opportunity to work on a real-world project, build your portfolio, and have fun with manga!
